            <p> Hello I am Marin Bailhe. I was born in Toulouse in France and have always been leaving in Toulouse until I came to Dublin. <br>
				I have studied piano for 13 years, and it was my principal activity from primary school to high school. <br>
				I started studying IT at EPITA and I am currently at Dorset College in Dublin for an international semester.
